## Introduction

Credit scoring models are essential tools in the financial industry for assessing the risk associated with lending money to individuals. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual repaying their debt based on their historical financial data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Development:** Implement various classification algorithms to predict creditworthiness.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve.
- **Visualization:** Visualize data distributions and model performance metrics.

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

- **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Model Training:** Train the model using various classification algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the creditworthiness of new individuals.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **F1 Score:** The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
- **AUC-ROC Curve:** A graphical representation of the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
